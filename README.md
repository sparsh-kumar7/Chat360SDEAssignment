# Log Ingestor and Query Interface

This Node.js project implements a Log Ingestor and Query Interface for managing logs in an application. The Log Ingestor captures logs from different stages of the application using multiple APIs, and the Query Interface provides a user interface (CLI) for searching and filtering logs.

## Features

### Log Ingestor:

1. **API Integration:**  I integrated APIs into the application to capture logs at different stages. Each API is configured to write logs to designated files, such as `log1.log`, `log2.log`, etc.

2. **Log Formatting:** Logs are standardized across all APIs to include essential information such as timestamp, log level, source, and log message. This ensures consistency in log format across the application.

3. **Logging Configuration:** I implemented a flexible mechanism to configure logging levels and file paths for each API. Developers can easily adjust logging settings through a configuration file (`config.json`) or environment variables.

4. **Error Handling:** Robust error handling is implemented to ensure that failures in logging do not disrupt the application's functionality. Errors are caught and appropriate actions are taken to maintain the integrity of the logging system.

### Advanced Features:

- **Allow combining multiple filters:** Developers can combine multiple filters (e.g., level, log string, timestamp, metadata source) to refine log searches and obtain more specific results.

- **Provide real-time log ingestion and searching capabilities:** Real-time log ingestion ensures that logs are captured and processed as soon as they are generated by the application. The Query Interface offers real-time searching capabilities, allowing developers to access the latest log data instantly.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sparsh-kumar7/Chat360SDEAssignment
   cd log-ingestor

2. **Install Dependencies**   
  ```bash
   npm install
```
3. **Run the Log Ingestor**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
## Test the Query Interface:

1. **CLI**: Use the command line interface to search and filter logs. Run node app and follow the prompts to perform searches.
  
2. **Postman**: To test the project hit the following endpoints in the Postman console, use method POST for both the endpoints. Once the endpoint is hit the console will ask for user input and Postman Console will show the desired ouput:

     **For Querying**
     ```bash
     http://localhost:3000/logs/search/
     ```
     **For Adding Logs**
     ```bash
     http://localhost:3000/logs/
     ```
